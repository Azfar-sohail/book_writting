# Physical AI & Humanoid Robots – An AI-Native Book - Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive AI-native textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. The textbook is built using Docusaurus and structured into 4 parts with 20 cohesive chapters.

## Mission
Create a comprehensive AI-native textbook that teaches Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics by bridging artificial intelligence.

## Structure
- **4 Parts**: Foundations, Perception, Control, Applications
- **20 Chapters**: Comprehensive coverage from basic concepts to advanced applications
- **Docusaurus Deployment**: Ready for web deployment and hosting
- **RAG Ready**: Structured for Retrieval-Augmented Generation applications
- **Personalization Ready**: Modular structure supports personalized learning paths
- **Translation Ready**: Internationalization support for multiple languages

## Target Audience
- Beginners to intermediate learners
- Engineering students
- AI and Robotics practitioners

## Technical Implementation
- Built with Docusaurus v3.1.0
- Markdown-based content for easy editing
- Internationalization support for 8 languages
- Algolia search integration for RAG applications
- Responsive design for multiple devices
- Modular content structure

# Physical AI & Humanoid Robots – An AI-Native Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-driven development
All content and features will be planned through detailed specifications before implementation. Each chapter and section will have clear acceptance criteria and requirements defined upfront.

### II. AI-first content creation
Content will be created with AI assistance from the ground up, ensuring that examples, explanations, and exercises leverage AI capabilities effectively.

### III. Clear learning progression
Chapters will follow a logical progression from beginner to intermediate concepts, with each building upon previous knowledge in a structured way.

### IV. Modular and reusable intelligence
Content will be organized in modular sections that can be reused, recombined, and adapted for different learning paths and audiences.

### V. Practical, example-driven instruction
Each concept will be accompanied by practical examples, code snippets, and real-world applications to reinforce learning.

### VI. Accessibility and Multilingual Support
Content will be structured to support RAG, personalization, and translation extensions from the beginning.

## Technology Stack and Requirements

The textbook will be deployed using Docusaurus as the documentation platform, with content written in Markdown format. The structure will support 20 cohesive chapters organized in a 4-part structure.

### Content Standards
- All content must be accessible to beginners to intermediate learners
- Engineering students and AI/Robotics practitioners should find value in each chapter
- Code examples should be practical and runnable
- Figures and diagrams should be included where appropriate

### Deployment Requirements
- Site must be deployable using Docusaurus
- Ready for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities
- Ready for personalization features
- Ready for translation extensions

## Development Workflow

Content development will follow the Spec-Driven Development methodology:
1. Create detailed specifications for each chapter
2. Plan the implementation with architectural decisions
3. Break down work into testable tasks
4. Implement content with proper review process
5. Maintain Prompt History Records for all changes
6. Document significant architectural decisions in ADRs

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices for this project. All changes to the textbook content must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified with clear learning benefits.

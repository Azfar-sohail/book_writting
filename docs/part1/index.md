# Part I: Foundations & Robotic Systems

This part establishes the foundational concepts necessary for understanding Physical AI and robotics systems. It covers the basic principles of Physical AI, fundamental robotics systems, the intersection of AI and physical systems, software stack considerations for humanoid robots, and the importance of simulation in robotics development.
